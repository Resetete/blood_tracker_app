Monocytes are produced in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream, where they can travel to different tissues and organs to help fight off infections and foreign substances.\n\nThe normal range for monocytes is between 2% to 10% of the total white blood cell count. A low monocyte count, called monocytopenia, can be caused by a variety of factors such as viral infections, autoimmune disorders, bone marrow disorders, or medications such as chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs. High monocyte counts, called monocytosis, can be caused by infections, inflammation, and certain types of cancer such as leukemia.\n\nMonocyte levels can be measured through a complete blood count (CBC) test, which is a standard test used to evaluate overall health and detect a wide range of medical conditions.\n\nCertain medications can cause low or high monocyte values. Corticosteroids can cause monocytopenia, while some immunosuppressive drugs can cause monocytosis. It is important to discuss any medications you are taking with your healthcare provider to understand their potential impact on your monocyte count.",

    description: "<p>Thrombocytes, also referred to as platelets, are small, irregularly-shaped blood cells that play a crucial role in the process of blood clotting, known as hemostasis.
    In the context of blood work, thrombocytes are commonly abbreviated as PLT, and their unit of measurement is typically reported as platelets per microliter of blood (10^9/L or thousand/Î¼L).
    The normal range for platelet counts in a healthy individual typically falls between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Deviations from this range may indicate certain medical conditions or factors that impact platelet production, survival, or consumption.
    Low platelet counts, referred to as thrombocytopenia, can be attributed to various factors, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Impaired platelet production in the bone marrow due to conditions like aplastic anemia, leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes.</li>
    <li> Increased platelet destruction or consumption resulting from autoimmune disorders, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</li>
    <li> Medications, including heparin, chemotherapeutic agents, or certain antibiotics.</li>
    <li> Viral infections, such as dengue fever or HIV.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>High platelet counts, known as thrombocytosis, can be caused by various factors, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Chronic inflammatory conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
    <li> Infections, such as tuberculosis or chronic hepatitis.</li>
    <li> Bone marrow disorders, including essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.</li>
    <li> Certain cancers, particularly those affecting the bone marrow or blood, like leukemia or lymphoma.</li>
